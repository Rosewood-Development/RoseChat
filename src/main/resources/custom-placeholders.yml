# Placeholders allow text, hover events, click events, and placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.
# These can be used in several sections within the other configs to add more information to chat.

# RoseChat has a few placeholders that do not require PlaceholderAPI:
# %player_name% - The player's name.
# %player_displayname% - The player's displayname.
# %group% - The ID of the group a message is sent in.
# %group_name% - The name of the group a message is sent in.
# %group_owner% - The owner of the group a message is sent in.
# %channel% - The name of the channel a message is sent in.
# %player_nickname% - The player's nickname, which is created by using RoseChat's /nick command.
#                     If a nickname does not exist, the displayname will be used.
#                     If the displayname does not exist, the name will be used.
# These placeholders can be prefixed with "other_" to get the viewer rather than the sender.
# For example, %other_player_name% gets the name of the viewer.
# {message} - An internal placeholder that is reserved for the player chat input.

# The ID of the custom placeholder.

    condition: "%vault_rank%"
    # These are the options that the condition's value needs to output.
    # If the player has a %vault_rank% output of "mod", their prefix will be set to "&8[&dMod&8] &d".
    # If the placeholder fails to get a result, or the placeholder is invalid, the "default" value will be used.
