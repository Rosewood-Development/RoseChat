# When a message containing the 'text' is sent in chat, it will be replaced with the 'replacement'.
# These can be used for custom color codes, general replacements, or regular expressions.
# These replacements can be used with placeholders from custom-placeholders.yml.
# Emojis can be defined in the emojis.yml, as they are parsed separately from replacements.
# Check the wiki for more information: https://github.com/Rosewood-Development/RoseChat/wiki/Configuration-Files#replacementsyml
rainbow:
  text: "&h"
  replacement: "<r:0.5>"

heart:
  text: "<3"
  replacement: "\u2764"

# The '%message%' placeholder can be used to get what was replaced.
# For example, this regex matches URLs. The replacement uses a placeholder (defined in custom-placeholders.yml) to make it hoverable and clickable.
regex-example:
  text: '(http(s){0,1}://){0,1}[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,32}\.[a-zA-Z0-9()]{2,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\+.~#?&//=]*)'
  replacement: "{url}"
  # This allows the plugin to parse it as a regular expression.
  regex: true
