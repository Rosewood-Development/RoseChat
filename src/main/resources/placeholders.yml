# Placeholders allow text, hover events, click events and placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.
# These can be used in several sections within the config.yml to add more information to chat.
# The {message} placeholder is reserved for sent messages.
# You can set the color of a message by using the placeholder before {message}.
# For example, the {extra} placeholder ends with '&f' this will set the message color to white.
# These placeholders may also be used within chat if the player has permission. Example: 'rosechat.placeholders.prefix'
# Check the wiki for more information:

# RoseChat has a few placeholders that do not require PlaceholderAPI:
# %player_name% - The player's name.
# %player_displayname% - The player's display name.
# %player_nickname% - The player's nickname that they created using RoseChat's /nick command.
# If a nickname does not exist then the display name will be used, if that does not exist then the name will be used.
# %group% - The id of the group a message is sent in.
# %group_name% - The name of the group a message is sent in.
# %group_owner% - The owner of the group a message is sent in.
# %channel% - The name of the channel a message is sent in.
# Placeholders can be prefixed with "other_" to get the viewer rather than the sender.
# For example, %other_player_name% gets the name of the viewer.

# The ID of the placeholder.
# This defines the {prefix} placeholder.
prefix:
  # This defines the text that will be shown.
  text:
    # Each placeholder has a condition that can be used.
    condition: "%vault_rank%"
    # These are the options that the condition needs to hit.
    # If the player who is sending the message has a rank of "admin", their prefix will be set to "&8[#C0FFEEAdmin&8] ".
    # If the placeholder fails to get a result, or the placeholder is invalid then the default value will be used.
    # If a default value doesn't exist, then nothing will happen.
