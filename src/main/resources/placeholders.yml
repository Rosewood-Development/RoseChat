# Placeholders allow text, hover events, click events and placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.
# These can be used in several sections within the config.yml to add more information to chat.
# The {message} placeholder is reserved for sent messages.
# You can set the colour of a message by using the placeholder before {message}.
# For example, the {extra} placeholder ends with '&f', this will set the message colour to white.

# The ID of the placeholder. This defines the {prefix} placeholder.
