# Placeholders
# These allow text, hover events, click events and placeholders from PlaceholderAPI.
# The {message} placeholder is reserved for sent messages. You can set the colour of a message using the placeholder before {message},
# e.g. the {extra} placeholder ends with &7, this changes the message colour to grey.
placeholders:

  # The ID of the placeholder. This defines the {prefix} placeholder.
  prefix:
    # This is the text that will be shown.
    text:
      # These are a list of groups and the prefixes that will be used for them.
      # If the player is not in any of the groups, it will use the default.
      # If Vault is not installed, it will use the default.
      # If the player is in more than one group it will use the primary group.
      default: "&7"
      admin: "&8[#C0FFEEAdmin&8] "
    # This tells the plugin that this placeholder is using a hover event.
    # Hover events show text and can have multiple lines.

      # The %player_name% placeholder is included in RoseChat, but most placeholders will need PlaceholderAPI.

    # The 'extra' is what will be executed.
